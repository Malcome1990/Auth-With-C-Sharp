# C# Auth Template With JWT

## Description

.NET 5.0 Webapi with basic authentication and JWT.
Currently it is congifigured to to use EF Core and Sqlite for development.
It also has methods for logging in and registering Users.
I built this to act as a starting point for future WebApis I want to build.
